# Interactive AI Chat Resume

## Overview
This project presents my professional experience in an interactive chat format, allowing visitors to explore my skills, experience, and background through a conversational interface.

## Why an Interactive AI Chat Resume?

### Standing Out in a Digital World
Traditional resumes often get lost in the sea of applicants. This interactive format creates a memorable experience for recruiters, hiring managers, and potential connections, making my application stand out from static PDFs and standard LinkedIn profiles.

### Demonstrating Technical Skills
The implementation itself showcases:
- Frontend development skills (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- UI/UX design sensibilities
- Creative problem-solving approach
- Familiarity with modern conversational interfaces

### Enhanced Engagement
The chat format transforms passive reading into active exploration:
- Visitors can ask specific questions about areas they're interested in
- Suggested questions guide users to discover relevant information
- The conversational nature creates a more personal connection
- Information is delivered in digestible chunks rather than overwhelming blocks of text

### Accessibility and User Control
- Users can explore my experience at their own pace and depth
- The interface adapts to different devices (responsive design)
- Dark/light theme options improve readability for different preferences
- Traditional resume view remains available for those who prefer it

## How It Works
This implementation uses vanilla JavaScript to create a simulated AI chat experience:
- Predefined responses mapped to user queries
- Context-aware suggested questions
- Simulated typing indicators for a realistic feel
- Agent personas (Ruby, Rails, Fullstack, AV) to organize information
- No external dependencies or backend requirements - runs entirely in the browser

## Features
- Interactive chat interface with realistic typing indicators
- Context-aware suggested questions
- Multiple "agent" personas focusing on different aspects of my experience
- Full traditional resume view
- Dark/light theme toggle
- Responsive design for all devices
- Simulated token usage tracking

## Getting Started

### Running Locally
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/interactive-resume.git
   cd interactive-resume
   ```

2. Open the project:
   - Simply open `index.html` in your web browser
   - No build steps or server setup required

3. Alternative local server (optional):
   - If you prefer using a local server, you can use Python's built-in HTTP server:
     ```
     # Python 3
     python -m http.server
     
     # Python 2
     python -m SimpleHTTPServer
     ```
   - Or use any other local development server of your choice
   - Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser

### Customizing
To use this as a template for your own interactive resume:
1. Update the personal information in the HTML
2. Modify the question-answer mapping in the JavaScript section
3. Update the styling to match your personal brand
